A string in Python is a sequence of characters enclosed in single ('), double ("), or triple (''' """) quotes. It is used to store text-based data, such as words, sentences, or symbols.

**Key Points About Strings:**
- Strings are immutable (cannot be changed after creation).
- They can be enclosed in single (' '), double (" "), or triple (''' ''' or """ """) quotes.
- Strings are indexed (each character has a position).
- They support various operations like slicing, concatenation, and formatting.

**Methods:**

- upper()      : Converts all characters to `uppercase`
- lower()      : Converts all characters to `lowercase`
- title()      : Capitalizes first letter of each word
- capitalize() : Capitalizes the first letter of the string
