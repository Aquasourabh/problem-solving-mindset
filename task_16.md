# Problem Statement
I have noticed a problem while studying Engineering. In India, most colleges focus more on making money and earning profits. Education is also percentage-based rather than learning-based. Keeping this problem in mind, I want to create a mini project that provides good learning methods. If students follow these methods, this problem can be solved.

# Objective
Build a project that focuses on learning-based education and allows students to earn money without depending on college.

# Functionalities
## Topic Selection
- Variables
- Data Types
- Strings and other data types
- Operators
- Conditional Statements
- Loops
- Functions
- Lambda and Higher-Order Functions
- Modules
- Error Handling
- File I/O

# Design Patterns
1. **Follow the DRY Principle**: Convert repetitive code into functions and modules.
2. **Use Modularity**: Ensure the project is modular for better organization and reusability.

# Technology Stack
- **Python** (CLI initially, with GUI implementation planned later)
