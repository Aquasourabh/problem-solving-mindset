# Task 3 : What is Variables and Data Types

- **Variables:** In Python Variables act as references to objects stored in memory.
```.py
name = "Sourabh"  # String variable
age = 25  # Integer variable
height = 5.9  # Float variable
is_student = True  # Boolean variable

# 2. Printing Variables
print(name)  # Outputs: Sourabh
print(age)  # Outputs: 25
print(height)  # Outputs: 5.9
print(is_student)  # Outputs: True

```
 
- **Data Types** In Python Data Types are refers what type of Data We are Storing in a Variable.
 
```.py
# Data Types in Python
# Python has several built-in data types, including:
# - int (integer)
# - float (decimal number)
# - str (string)
# - bool (boolean, True/False)
# - list, tuple, set, dict (covered later)

# 3. Type Checking
print(type(name))  # Outputs: <class 'str'>
print(type(age))  # Outputs: <class 'int'>
print(type(height))  # Outputs: <class 'float'>
print(type(is_student))  # Outputs: <class 'bool'>

```
