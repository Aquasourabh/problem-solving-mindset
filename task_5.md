# Task 5 :Some other Data Types List,Tuples,Dictionaries and Sets.

- **Lists:** A list is an ordered collection of elements, which can be modified (mutable). It allows duplicate values and different data types.

<!-- ```
    # my_list = [1, 2, 3, "Sourabh", 3.5, True]  # List with mixed data types. 

     ``` -->

- **Tuples:** A tuple is like a list but immutable (cannot be changed after creation). It is faster than lists.

- **Dictionaries:** A dictionary stores data in key-value pairs. It is used for fast lookups and requires unique keys

- **Sets:** A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. It is useful for removing duplicates and performing set operations.
