# Task 5 :Some other Data Types List,Tuples,Dictionaries and Sets.

- **Lists:** A list is an ordered collection of elements, which can be modified (mutable). It allows duplicate values and different data types.

 ```py
  my_list = [1, 2, 3, "Sourabh", 3.5, True]  # List with mixed data types

  ``` 

- **Tuples:** A tuple is like a list but immutable (cannot be changed after creation). It is faster than lists.
  
```py
 my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, "Sourabh", 3.5)

``` 

- **Dictionaries:** A dictionary stores data in key-value pairs. It is used for fast lookups and requires unique keys.
```py
  my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}
``` 
  
- **Sets:** A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. It is useful for removing duplicates and performing set operations.
```py
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5}  # Duplicates are removed automatically

```
