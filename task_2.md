## Task 2: Basic Syntax

### Objective
Understand basic syntax, indentation, and comments (single-line `#` and multi-line `''' ... '''`).

### Indentation
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a line. Python uses indentation to define blocks of code.

```python
# This is a single-line comment (Use # to denote a single-line comment)
print("This refers to # syntax of the single-line comment")  # This prints the statement.

```

### Multi-line Comments
```python
""" This is a multi-line comment
You can use it if you are writing a description.
"""
print("This follows the right indentation")
